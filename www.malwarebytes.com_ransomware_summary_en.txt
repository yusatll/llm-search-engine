Here is a long summary of the document:

The document discusses the growing threat of ransomware attacks, which have become more sophisticated and widespread over the past few years. In 2019, Malwarebytes discovered the Maze family of ransomware, which is known for its "double extortion" attack, where they both encrypt files and steal data from the victim, threatening to publish it online unless a ransom is paid.

In addition to Maze, other notable ransomware gangs that emerged in 2019 include REvil (also known as Sodin or Sodinokibi), which uses a Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) model to sell its software to others, and Egregor, which is thought to be a successor to the Maze ransomware family.

The document also notes that while ransomware attacks on individuals have been a problem for several years, attacks on businesses, hospitals, healthcare systems, schools, school districts, local governments, and other organizations have become increasingly prominent in 2021. Examples of high-profile attacks include those on Colonial Pipeline, JB Meatpacker, Steamship Authority (the largest ferry service in Massachusetts), and others.

The US government has taken notice of the growing threat, with the creation of the website StopRansomware.gov to bring together information on stopping and surviving ransomware attacks. The document also mentions that the US government has said that ransomware will be investigated like terrorism.

The rest of 2021 and 2022 are likely to bring continued threats from ransomware gangs, but the document encourages readers to stay informed through future updates on this page and the Malwarebytes Labs blog for the latest in cybersecurity news.

The final section of the document appears to be a marketing pitch for Malwarebytes' products and services, including Managed Detection and Response (MDR), Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR), and Endpoint Security.
